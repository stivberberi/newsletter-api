# Rust Newsletter API

This newsletter API is based on the book by Lucas Palmieri; [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html?country_code=CA)

## User Stories
The goal of this project will be to fulfill the following "user stories":

* As a blog visitor, I want to subscribe to the newsletter, so that I can receive email updates when new content is published to the blog.
* As a blog author, I want to send an email to all my subscribers, so that  I can notify them when new content is published.
* As a subscriber, I want to be able to unsubscribe from the newsletter, so that I can stop receiving email updates from the blog.
